# Bomb Tag

Bomb Tag is a game made by four 1st year students under my direction. The goal of the project was to allow these 4 beginners students who mostly never had coded before (nor used Unity) to discover how a game is made. With this idea in mind, I tried to direct them the best I could but I didn't take too much part in the production process. Thanks to this methodology they were able to acquire a good amount of knowledge by resolving issues by themselves and by learning from their mistakes.
The result is this game, is of course still bugged and incomplete, but it's also a good playable prototype that they can be proud of.

## The game

Bomb Tag is a local competitive multiplayer game.

The goal of the game is to be the richer among the players by collecting the maximum amount of cash in your bank ! The player with the maximum amount of cash at the end of the timer wins ! 💰

Every player starts the game in his own banks, you can collect up to a maximum amount of 10 pieces in you pockets and you can store them at the bank anytime, except during the BombTime 🔒

 🚨 The BombTime is an event happenning multiple times over the course of the game, a bomb appears randomly on a player ! 💣
If the player with the bomb catches you, you get the bomb ! 💀
At the end of a timer, the bomb explode and kills the owner and all nearby players, they loose the pieces they in their pockets and respawn in their banks. 💥

📦 Items are present on the map to help you during the game :

Shield : Protects you from the negative effects, you can't recieve the bomb if you're shielded !  
Bear trap : Stop the player from moving.  
Magnet : Attract the pieces to you.
